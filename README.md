# Romeu Franzoia jr

I'm an experienced Back-end Developer and Systems Analyst, with strong knowledge of Java 8, databases programming (Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL and others), micro services development using spring framework, spring boot and their associated frameworks like Hibernate, JPA, etc. Have been working with Java for the last 13 years, and recently started working with JSP and React, along with  AWS (SQS, EC2, S3) and Web Services. I also have good knowledge of other technologies such as Docker, Bio-metrics and NoSQL databases. I’m a fast learner and I'm constantly looking forward to learn new technologies, face new challenges and improving my abilities.
